                <h2>A little info about Hedy Lamarr</h2>
                <div class="content">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Was born in <strong>November 9, 1914</strong> in Vienna.</li>
                        <li>At the <b>age of 12</b>, she won a beauty contest in Vienna and also began to associate
                            invention with her father.</li>
                        <li>She was hired at the age of <b>16</b> as a script girl</li>
                        <li>She gained a role as an extra in Money on the Street (1930),
                            and then a small speaking part in Storm in a Water Glass (1931).</li>
                        <li>Although Lamarr had no formal training and was primarily self-taught,
                            she worked in her spare time on various hobbies and inventions,
                            which included an improved traffic stoplight and a tablet that would dissolve in water to create
                            a
                            carbonated drink. <br> The beverage was unsuccessful; Lamarr herself said it tasted like
                            Alka-Seltzer.
                        </li>
                        <li><b><i>During World War II</i></b>, Lamarr learned that radio-controlled torpedoes,
                            an emerging technology in naval war, could easily be jammed and set off course. </li>
                        <li><b>In 1997</b>, Electronic Frontier Foundation officially awarded the actress for inventing
                            FHSS. In
                            2014 Hedy was introduced to the Inventors’ Hall of Fame. Her unconventional trivia and the
                            ongoing media buzz around her name transformed the story of her life into a legend which
                            continues to evolve every day adorned by new details imagined or discovered by various authors.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                  <p>
                            Lamarr is considered the inventor of the frequency-hopping method,
                            which is still used by many communication protocols,
                            including GPS, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and CDMA.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Lamarr and her partner George Antheil hold a patent for
                            ‘secret communication systems involving the use of carrier waves of different frequencies.’
                            This idea served the basis for a communication method called Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum
                            (FHSS).
                            <b>FHSS paved the way to a handful of modern wireless technologies we use
                                daily.</b>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At 25 Lamarr was investigating the potential of hormones to increase the size of her breasts.
                            This search introduced her to George Antheil.
                        </p>
                   <p>
                            After an exchange about the female anatomy, the
                            conversation shifted to torpedoes. <b> was aware of the principles used in
                                radio-controlled torpedoes. </b>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As Lamarr used to say, <b> “Any girl can be charming.
                                You only need to stand still and act stupid.”</b>
                            She did not get any education in applied science.
                            Instead, the young Jewish girl finished drama school and made her movie debut at 16-years old.
                        </p>
    
                        <p>
                            Three years later she starred in ‘Ecstasy,’ a controversial movie that transformed Lamarr
                            into an icon. The film featured some nude scenes for the first time in the entire history
                            of the cinematography.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the same movie Lamarr also <b>became the first actress
                                to imitate an orgasm on camera</b> – a scene as novel as it was scandalous.
